# Pod Security Context

Defines the security settings for a Pod within Kubernetes, as managed by Piceli. The security context applies to all containers running within a given pod and is crucial for maintaining the security posture of your Kubernetes deployments.

## Overview

A Pod's security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod. These settings include defining the user and group IDs that will run the containers and configuring the containers to run without root privileges whenever possible. Additionally, it allows for the enforcement of other security policies like SELinux, AppArmor, and seccomp profiles.

## Function: `get_security_context`

This function generates a Kubernetes `V1PodSecurityContext` object based on provided UID settings, ensuring pods are run with specific user and group IDs and enforcing containers to run as non-root.

### Parameters

- `security_context_uid`: Optional integer specifying the UID to be used for running containers within the pod. If provided, it sets the `fs_group`, `run_as_group`, and `run_as_user` fields with this UID, enforcing containers to run as this user/group. Additionally, it configures the pod to run as non-root (`run_as_non_root=True`) and applies a default seccomp profile for added security.

### Returns

- An instance of `client.V1PodSecurityContext` configured with the specified security settings if `security_context_uid` is provided; otherwise, `None`.

The `get_security_context` function is a crucial component used in defining Pod configurations within Piceli, ensuring that pods are deployed with necessary security measures in place. This function is specifically utilized in the ` {pod}``./pod ` module to apply security contexts to pods, contributing to the overall security of the Kubernetes environment managed by Piceli.
