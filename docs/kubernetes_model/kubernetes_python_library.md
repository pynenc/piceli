# Defining Kubernetes Objects with the Python Client Library

Within Piceli Docs, you have the flexibility to define Kubernetes objects directly using the [official Kubernetes Python client library](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python). This approach allows you to leverage the full spectrum of Kubernetes API capabilities directly from Python, making your infrastructure as code (IaC) definitions both powerful and versatile.

## Introduction

The Kubernetes Python client library provides a comprehensive interface to the Kubernetes API, enabling developers to create, update, and delete Kubernetes resources programmatically. When used in conjunction with Piceli, it empowers you to define complex Kubernetes resources in a Pythonic way, integrating seamlessly with the rest of your Piceli infrastructure definitions.

## Example: Defining a Kubernetes Service

Below is an example of how to define a Service using the Kubernetes Python client library:

```python
from kubernetes import client

def create_service_example(name, labels, ports, selector):
    # Define the Kubernetes Service
    service = client.V1Service(
        api_version="v1",
        kind="Service",
        metadata=client.V1ObjectMeta(
            name=name,
            labels=labels
        ),
        spec=client.V1ServiceSpec(
            ports=ports,
            type="ClusterIP",
            selector=selector
        )
    )
    return service
```

In this example, create_service_example is a function that creates a V1Service object. This function can be adapted to fit the specific requirements of your application, such as configuring different types of services (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort) or setting up more complex port and selector configurations.

## Integration with Piceli

When defining Kubernetes resources using the Python client library in Piceli, it's important to remember:

- Resource Compatibility: Ensure the resources you define are compatible with your Kubernetes cluster version.
- Resource Management: While Piceli automates much of the deployment and management process, defining resources accurately is crucial for successful deployments.
- Best Practices: Follow Kubernetes and Python best practices for resource definitions, including naming conventions, resource limits, and security settings.

## Conclusion

Using the Kubernetes Python client library within Piceli offers a powerful way to define Kubernetes objects programmatically, combining the flexibility of Python with the robustness of Kubernetes resource management. This approach enhances your IaC practices, allowing for dynamic and scalable infrastructure definitions that meet the needs of modern cloud-native applications.
