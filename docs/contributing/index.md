# Contributing to Piceli

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Piceli! At this moment, the project is in its initial development phase and is not yet open for external contributions. We are diligently working towards a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and establishing a stable foundation.

Once the project reaches a stage where community contributions can be integrated, this guide will be updated with detailed instructions on the contribution process. For now, we invite you to watch the repository for updates and participate in issue discussions.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your contributions in the future!
