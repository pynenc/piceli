# Overview

## Piceli: Infrastructure Management for Kubernetes and Cloud Providers

Piceli is conceived as a comprehensive framework for managing infrastructure across Kubernetes and cloud providers. This overview sheds light on Piceli's key functionalities, architectural principles, and the vision for its future evolution.

## Core Features and Design Philosophy

Piceli offers a suite of features designed to simplify the management of complex infrastructures:

- **Automated Deployment Plans**: Piceli generates deployment plans automatically, considering dependencies and execution order to streamline the deployment process across environments.

- **Smart Management of Kubernetes Resources**: Through intelligent analysis, Piceli manages Kubernetes objects by applying actions such as patches and replacements, enhancing system stability and efficiency.

- **Cloud Provider Integration (Future Development)**: Piceli aims to extend its management capabilities beyond Kubernetes, allowing users to orchestrate cloud resources directly, facilitating a unified infrastructure management solution.

- **Extensive Compatibility and Modularity**: Designed with modularity at its core, Piceli supports a wide range of Kubernetes objects and cloud services, enabling flexible and scalable infrastructure solutions.

## Current Capabilities and Planned Expansions

- **Current State**: At present, Piceli manages Kubernetes environments.

- **Future Directions**: The roadmap includes expanding Piceli's functionalities to manage cloud provider resources, such as GKE clusters on GCP, and enhancing its adaptability to various cloud services and infrastructure models.

## Emphasis on Efficiency and Scalability

Piceli is built with a focus on optimizing the deployment and management processes, ensuring that infrastructures can scale seamlessly:

- **Efficient Resource Management**: Piceli's deployment engine is designed to handle resources efficiently, reducing overhead and optimizing utilization.

- **Scalable Architecture**: The framework's architecture is scalable, supporting the management of infrastructures ranging from small-scale projects to large enterprise environments.

## Conclusion

Piceli is a tool in the realm of infrastructure management, bridging the gap between Kubernetes resource orchestration and comprehensive cloud provider management. It's structured to foster innovation, simplicity, and effectiveness, facilitating the seamless interoperability of components across the infrastructure stack.
